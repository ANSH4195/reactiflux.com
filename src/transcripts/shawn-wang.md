<a name="what-do-you-think-about-writing" href="#what-do-you-think-about-writing">#</a> **Q:** What do you think about writing on your own Blog vs Writing on a website like dev.to or hashnode? â€“ yashguptaz

**A:** I do both! https://www.swyx.io/writing/devto-cms/.

<a name="most-innovative-react" href="#most-innovative-react">#</a> **Q:** Most innovative React libraries? â€“ The Benevolent Dictator

**A:** I gotta say I have a soft spot for [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h0npbn/immer_v70_new_current_api/ and [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) and I also think Redwood and Blitz are doing awesome things in the meta-framework side.

<a name="what-do-you-love" href="#what-do-you-love">#</a> **Q:** What do you love the most about JS development and vice versa (hate)? â€“ seasmurph

**A:** JS tooling! https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-tooling/ can't live without them, and they can be so much better.

---

<a name="how-do-you-see-the-react-library" href="#how-do-you-see-the-react-library">#</a> **Q:** How do you see the React library in the next 5 years? is it going to be replaced by other libs like [Svelte][svelte] or others ? Do you still recommend people using this? â€“ Masoud

**A:** No, not replaced. React is extremely successful and has a huge community. I think it has different goals from [Svelte][svelte]. Currently, I recommend React for xplatform apps, [Svelte][svelte] for interactive sites.

---

<a name="do-you-have-any-suggested" href="#do-you-have-any-suggested">#</a> **Q:** Do you have any suggested tutorials for React beginners? â€“ riz

**A:** Tes we pin good free tutorials on the [/r/reactjs][r-reactjs] beginners thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gukkex/beginners_thread_easy_questions_june_2020/

---

<a name="is-now-a-good-time" href="#is-now-a-good-time">#</a> **Q:** Is now a good time to learn React and start learning it with hooks only (and forgot class-based components)? â€“ TotomInc

**A:** Now is a VERY good time to learn React. Unfortunately, you cannot omit class based components, unless you never intend to work with anyone else's React code ever. Legacy is a powerful thing. We are in a weird transitional time where in an effort to make React simpler in the long term, we made React more complicated in the short term. Deal with it.

---

<a name="do-you-think-adding-subtyping" href="#do-you-think-adding-subtyping">#</a> **Q:** Do you think adding subtyping to typescript was a mistake? â€“ Yugiohxlight

**A:** No idea. I think we should be happy to admit when we don't know things ðŸ™‚. By the way I think it is a good pitch for [reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io/).

---

<a name="when-should-components-be" href="#when-should-components-be">#</a> **Q:** When should components be memoized? â€“ esfox

**A:** When they are expensive to render.

---

<a name="is-it-just-me-or-does" href="#is-it-just-me-or-does">#</a> **Q:** Is it just me or does a lot of the AWS UX seem really unintuitive and a pain to work with? â€“ rixcy

**A:** Not just you. We feel it too. Working on it.

---

<a name="why-are-webmentions" href="#why-are-webmentions">#</a> **Q:** Why are [webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) important? â€“ b3u

**A:** They help keep the web "indie". I like that it gives credit to people on their own domains. However the implementation leaves much to be desired. For those who want to learn more about webmentions - https://www.swyx.io/writing/clientside-webmentions/.

---

<a name="welcome-its-so-nice-to" href="#welcome-its-so-nice-to">#</a> **Q:** Welcome. It's so nice to have you here and congrats on joining [Amplify][amplify]!

Do you have advice on making the switch from dev to dev rel/advocate type roles? How does an engineer break into that space when so few companies have a need for the role especially if we aren't twitter famous already :P â€“ Sonicrida

**A:** Hey I see you ðŸ™‚. Well fwiw when I got my first devrel role at Netlify, I had not even given my first conference talk, I had given only 2 meetup talks (React NYC meetup), and wrote a few crappy blog posts. However, I was very very consistent in learning in public and practicing marketing for others. If you market yourself well, other companies will want you to help market them. https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/

<a name="do-you-think-react-native" href="#do-you-think-react-native">#</a> **Q:** Do you think react native has a future on apple devices, or do you suspect apple will eventually mandate SwiftUI? â€“ Pat

**A:** I want to caveat that I basically don't do any RN. Last time I touched RN was when I interviewed with g2i ðŸ™‚. Imo it has a future. The investment in RN is HUGE. Also, compiling to SwiftUI is not out of the question. But Idk.

---

<a name="where-does-amplify-need" href="#where-does-amplify-need">#</a> **Q:** Where does [Amplify][amplify] need to improve the most? â€“ RossWilliams

**A:** Oooh nice one. Everywhere lol. I have spent the last 2 weeks filing issues internally. As far as "The Most" - I think the auth experience needs to get a lot better. Not everyone wants to use [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) and the interaction between auth and other services is not well documented. That's my job. ðŸ™‚

---

<a name="why-is-jamstack" href="#why-is-jamstack">#</a> **Q:** Why is [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) getting so much popularity these days? â€“ junaid

**A:** Because of my old team at [Netlify][netlify]! Jk. I have given a bunch of talks about this https://www.swyx.io/speaking/jamstack-rise/ - It is the confluence of 5 different trends all coming at once. we are collapsing layers between CI/CD and CDN. Btw, the static site generator version of [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) will be even more popular in future because of Web Vitals prioritizing minimal relayouts. It's faster, cheaper, (comparatively) more secure.

<a name="whats-the-best-place-for-getting" href="#whats-the-best-place-for-getting">#</a> **Q:** What's the best place for getting online freelance work on React or can you give tips on it? Thanks. â€“ arsalan

**A:** No idea, I only freelanced for 2 months when I was looking for my first job. We have a Who's Hiring and Who's Available thread on r/reactjs https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gudtmn/whos_hiring_june_2020/ you can check out.

<a name="is-blazor-from-microsoft" href="#is-blazor-from-microsoft">#</a> **Q:** Is [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)) from Microsoft going to overtake React and Angular? â€“ MelvinPhasor

**A:** lol wat no.

---

<a name="why-did-you-choose-to-create" href="#why-did-you-choose-to-create">#</a> **Q:** Why did you choose to create [r/reactjs][r-reactjs]? Any motivation behind it? â€“ meet_zaveri

**A:** I did not create [/r/reactjs][r-reactjs]! Our top mods disappeared a long time ago. I only became a mod because Dan Abramov wanted my help to clamp down on framework bashing.

---

<a name="what-react-library-redux" href="#what-react-library-redux">#</a> **Q:** What react library (redux, redux saga, context api, etc) would you recommend to start building large scale apps? â€“ iamaul

**A:** We used Redux to build [Netlify][netlify] and it works very well for us. I have never liked [redux saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) but tbh I never gave it an honest shot. I would be interested in [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) for large scale apps too, but unfortunately have not had production exp with them.

---

<a name="any-clue-what-might" href="#any-clue-what-might">#</a> **Q:** Any clue what might come after React or which direction it will evolve towards? â€“ The Benevolent Dictator

**A:** https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-third-age/

https://www.swyx.io/writing/react-distros/ double answer ðŸ™‚.

<a name="where-do-you-see-aws" href="#where-do-you-see-aws">#</a> **Q:** Where do you see AWS can make a difference when writing frontend applications? I'm not talking about serverless, I'm more interested on the web part. â€“ Mathis

**A:** Ah. Have you seen [Amplify Datastore](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js)? Basically the idea that the upper limit to how fast we can make apps feel is that we have to write all our operations to a local cache and let it sync to backend with a deterministic contract. We then also get offline-first apps for free. https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/108d90755aa3f34401dcb488c2f0f5aa

<a name="do-you-know-libs-articles" href="#do-you-know-libs-articles">#</a> **Q:** Do you know libs, articles or other, that help to handle redux state updates in a canvas context (like PIXI.js) ? More generally, uses of canvas in React-Redux env. â€“ Chnapy

**A:** No, sorry. Ask @acemarke.
