<a name="what-do-you-think-about-writing" href="#what-do-you-think-about-writing">#</a> **Q:** What do you think about writing on your own Blog vs Writing on a website like dev.to or hashnode? – yashguptaz

**A:** I do both! https://www.swyx.io/writing/devto-cms/.

---

<a name="most-innovative-react" href="#most-innovative-react">#</a> **Q:** Most innovative React libraries? – The Benevolent Dictator

**A:** I gotta say I have a soft spot for [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/h0npbn/immer_v70_new_current_api/ and [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) and I also think Redwood and Blitz are doing awesome things in the meta-framework side.

---

<a name="what-do-you-love" href="#what-do-you-love">#</a> **Q:** What do you love the most about JS development and vice versa (hate)? – seasmurph

**A:** JS tooling! https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-tooling/ can't live without them, and they can be so much better.

---

<a name="how-do-you-see-the-react-library" href="#how-do-you-see-the-react-library">#</a> **Q:** How do you see the React library in the next 5 years? is it going to be replaced by other libs like [Svelte][svelte] or others ? Do you still recommend people using this? – Masoud

**A:** No, not replaced. React is extremely successful and has a huge community. I think it has different goals from [Svelte][svelte]. Currently, I recommend React for xplatform apps, [Svelte][svelte] for interactive sites.

---

<a name="do-you-have-any-suggested" href="#do-you-have-any-suggested">#</a> **Q:** Do you have any suggested tutorials for React beginners? – riz

**A:** Tes we pin good free tutorials on the [/r/reactjs][r-reactjs] beginners thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gukkex/beginners_thread_easy_questions_june_2020/

---

<a name="is-now-a-good-time" href="#is-now-a-good-time">#</a> **Q:** Is now a good time to learn React and start learning it with hooks only (and forgot class-based components)? – TotomInc

**A:** Now is a VERY good time to learn React. Unfortunately, you cannot omit class based components, unless you never intend to work with anyone else's React code ever. Legacy is a powerful thing. We are in a weird transitional time where in an effort to make React simpler in the long term, we made React more complicated in the short term. Deal with it.

---

<a name="do-you-think-adding-subtyping" href="#do-you-think-adding-subtyping">#</a> **Q:** Do you think adding subtyping to TypeScript was a mistake? – Yugiohxlight

**A:** No idea. I think we should be happy to admit when we don't know things 🙂. By the way I think it is a good pitch for [reasonml](https://reasonml.github.io/).

---

<a name="when-should-components-be" href="#when-should-components-be">#</a> **Q:** When should components be memoized? – esfox

**A:** When they are expensive to render.

---

<a name="is-it-just-me-or-does" href="#is-it-just-me-or-does">#</a> **Q:** Is it just me or does a lot of the AWS UX seem really unintuitive and a pain to work with? – rixcy

**A:** Not just you. We feel it too. Working on it.

---

<a name="why-are-webmentions" href="#why-are-webmentions">#</a> **Q:** Why are [webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) important? – b3u

**A:** They help keep the web "indie". I like that it gives credit to people on their own domains. However the implementation leaves much to be desired. For those who want to learn more about webmentions - https://www.swyx.io/writing/clientside-webmentions/.

---

<a name="welcome-its-so-nice-to" href="#welcome-its-so-nice-to">#</a> **Q:** Welcome. It's so nice to have you here and congrats on joining [Amplify][amplify]!

Do you have advice on making the switch from dev to dev rel/advocate type roles? How does an engineer break into that space when so few companies have a need for the role especially if we aren't twitter famous already :P – Sonicrida

**A:** Hey I see you 🙂. Well fwiw when I got my first devrel role at Netlify, I had not even given my first conference talk, I had given only 2 meetup talks (React NYC meetup), and wrote a few crappy blog posts. However, I was very very consistent in learning in public and practicing marketing for others. If you market yourself well, other companies will want you to help market them. https://www.swyx.io/writing/marketing-yourself/

---

<a name="do-you-think-react-native" href="#do-you-think-react-native">#</a> **Q:** Do you think react native has a future on apple devices, or do you suspect apple will eventually mandate SwiftUI? – Pat

**A:** I want to caveat that I basically don't do any RN. Last time I touched RN was when I interviewed with g2i 🙂. Imo it has a future. The investment in RN is HUGE. Also, compiling to SwiftUI is not out of the question. But Idk.

---

<a name="where-does-amplify-need" href="#where-does-amplify-need">#</a> **Q:** Where does [Amplify][amplify] need to improve the most? – RossWilliams

**A:** Oooh nice one. Everywhere lol. I have spent the last 2 weeks filing issues internally. As far as "The Most" - I think the auth experience needs to get a lot better. Not everyone wants to use [Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) and the interaction between auth and other services is not well documented. That's my job. 🙂

---

<a name="why-is-jamstack" href="#why-is-jamstack">#</a> **Q:** Why is [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) getting so much popularity these days? – junaid

**A:** Because of my old team at [Netlify][netlify]! Jk. I have given a bunch of talks about this https://www.swyx.io/speaking/jamstack-rise/ - It is the confluence of 5 different trends all coming at once. we are collapsing layers between CI/CD and CDN. Btw, the static site generator version of [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) will be even more popular in future because of Web Vitals prioritizing minimal relayouts. It's faster, cheaper, (comparatively) more secure.

---

<a name="whats-the-best-place-for-getting" href="#whats-the-best-place-for-getting">#</a> **Q:** What's the best place for getting online freelance work on React or can you give tips on it? Thanks. – arsalan

**A:** No idea, I only freelanced for 2 months when I was looking for my first job. We have a Who's Hiring and Who's Available thread on r/reactjs https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/gudtmn/whos_hiring_june_2020/ you can check out.

---

<a name="is-blazor-from-microsoft" href="#is-blazor-from-microsoft">#</a> **Q:** Is [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)) from Microsoft going to overtake React and Angular? – MelvinPhasor

**A:** lol wat no.

---

<a name="why-did-you-choose-to-create" href="#why-did-you-choose-to-create">#</a> **Q:** Why did you choose to create [r/reactjs][r-reactjs]? Any motivation behind it? – meet_zaveri

**A:** I did not create [/r/reactjs][r-reactjs]! Our top mods disappeared a long time ago. I only became a mod because Dan Abramov wanted my help to clamp down on framework bashing.

---

<a name="what-react-library-redux" href="#what-react-library-redux">#</a> **Q:** What react library (redux, redux saga, context api, etc) would you recommend to start building large scale apps? – iamaul

**A:** We used Redux to build [Netlify][netlify] and it works very well for us. I have never liked [redux saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) but tbh I never gave it an honest shot. I would be interested in [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) and [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) for large scale apps too, but unfortunately have not had production exp with them.

---

<a name="any-clue-what-might" href="#any-clue-what-might">#</a> **Q:** Any clue what might come after React or which direction it will evolve towards? – The Benevolent Dictator

**A:** https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-third-age/

https://www.swyx.io/writing/react-distros/ double answer 🙂.

---

<a name="where-do-you-see-aws" href="#where-do-you-see-aws">#</a> **Q:** Where do you see AWS can make a difference when writing frontend applications? I'm not talking about serverless, I'm more interested on the web part. – Mathis

**A:** Ah. Have you seen [Amplify Datastore](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js)? Basically the idea that the upper limit to how fast we can make apps feel is that we have to write all our operations to a local cache and let it sync to backend with a deterministic contract. We then also get offline-first apps for free. https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/108d90755aa3f34401dcb488c2f0f5aa

---

<a name="do-you-know-libs-articles" href="#do-you-know-libs-articles">#</a> **Q:** Do you know libs, articles or other, that help to handle redux state updates in a canvas context (like PIXI.js) ? More generally, uses of canvas in React-Redux env. – Chnapy

**A:** No, sorry. Ask @acemarke.

---

<a name="why-do-algorithms-play" href="#why-do-algorithms-play">#</a> **Q:** Why do algorithms play such a big role in the job hiring process? Are there elements of every coding project that require data structure implementation? – dchavours

**A:** Traditionally we hired engineers to write low level/systems code. Over time, the need for that decreased as we moved higher and higher up the stack. However, interview practices have been slow to evolve. https://www.swyx.io/writing/osi-layers-coding-careers/ However you might like knowing both my technical interviews at AWS and [Netlify][netlify] involved no algorithms.

---

<a name="didnt-realize-you-had-joined" href="#didnt-realize-you-had-joined">#</a> **Q:** Didn't realize you had joined AWS, how was your interview experience at AWS? Any blogs coming up about that? Interested especially you come from a non-CS background like me & I would love to join the FAANG gang someday. – \_binarynumber

**A:** Thanks! yea it still feels weird to say that I'm part of FAANG now lol. It used to be so unattainable back when I was in bootcamp. Now I am actively saying no to fb 🤷‍♂️. I don't have plans to blog about it because I think my own journey is quite unique. However, I would advise to take the recruiter's tips very seriously. They REALLY care about the 14 leadership principles at Amazon. If you want to be hired into a senior role you have to have good stories that relate to most of them.

---

<a name="what-do-you-think-about-deno" href="#what-do-you-think-about-deno">#</a> **Q:** What do you think about [Deno][deno]? Do you think it'll go mainstream one day? – bellu, Junaid

**A:** Yes. It will be a key part of the Third Age of JS https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-third-age/. However, most platforms will simply support both node and [Deno][deno] and I don't think node dies.

---

<a name="how-do-you-guys-use-react" href="#how-do-you-guys-use-react">#</a> **Q:** How do you guys use React at AWS? – rhesa

**A:** React is used HEAVILY at AWS. There are so many engineers using it that we hold our own internal React Conf with a few hundred people. I'm afraid I don't know much more than that. I will be interested to find out more once COVID clears, and I can go visit Seattle.

---

<a name="thanks-for-the-reply" href="#thanks-for-the-reply">#</a> **Q:** Thanks for the reply! What is your day to day looking like now (or what will it look like as you settle in?) I'm really curious about how much you interact with the main devs on the team to learn more and become an expert with [Amplify][amplify] so you can teach the rest of us. What is that process like and how much time do you spend learning vs content creation/delivery. – Sonicrida

**A:** Honestly right now im just 100% learning lol. I had my first meetings with PMs yesterday. I normally LOVE to work directly with the dev team, and did that at [Netlify][netlify], but at AWS my sense is that won't be as possible anymore (because of team structure and size). Sorry I don't have a set % of learning vs content creation, probably in your first year you are mostly learning and you only really get on your content game in your second year. But don't forget the other big part of the job is helping beta test new features, visiting customers and collating product feedback.

---

<a name="what-are-your-thoughts-on-typescript" href="#what-are-your-thoughts-on-typescript">#</a> **Q:** What are your thoughts on TypeScript? Is it still worth learning in 2020? – bellu

**A:** Uh, YES!! LEARN IT. look at how many tools have switched https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1260888049958838272?s=20.

---

<a name="for-someone-who-wants-to-become" href="#for-someone-who-wants-to-become">#</a> **Q:** For someone who wants to become a better engineer (not just coding and leetcode stuff...) Does your book discuss topics like technical communication, engineering documents and other skills that are sometimes lacked? Can you give an example of one? – dilraj

**A:** We have a whole chapter on writing, and the Senior Dev chapter discusses a lot of the other organizational/metalearning skills needed. Basically the whole book is written to help you discuss the non code part of coding careers 🙂. Table of contents here https://gumroad.com/products/bAZJq/.

---

<a name="is-it-a-good-idea-to-convert" href="#is-it-a-good-idea-to-convert">#</a> **Q:** Is it good idea to convert legacy react application into TypeScript? – Banu

**A:** If it isn't broken, don't fix it!!!!! However, if you intend to maintain it for the long run, then yes TypeScript is a very good tool for that. It is meant to help you refactor incrementally. Have a look at how millie at TinyMCE and Brie at airbnb did their migrations. HUGE codebases. A lot of benefit. https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/migration/intro/#misc-migration-stories-by-notable-companies-and-open-source

---

<a name="i-believe-you-were-doing" href="#i-believe-you-were-doing">#</a> **Q:** I believe you were doing Georgia Tech's OMS program, how is it going and what is your review of it? Would you recommend it for non Computer Science folks to take it? – Andrei_Calazans

**A:** I dropped it after 3 classes. basically [Netlify][netlify] got super intense, and I had to choose between my class load and real work. I still want to pick it up again someday. I 100% recommend it for non CS folks because its cheap, and it helps fill the gaps you may have. Also, having a Msc in CS helps with hiring in some cases. A lot of people take it and focus on ML; do that if you must, But I was more keen on CS basics like compilers, databases, operating systems.

---

<a name="do-you-think-social-skills" href="#do-you-think-social-skills">#</a> **Q:** Do you think social skills play an important role in the success along with technical skills? – junaid

**A:** Yes! Even though I'm not the best at social skills myself. But clearly I think it is important, that's why I wrote a 450 page book on all that stuff. 🙂

---

<a name="how-to-get-seo-to-work" href="#how-to-get-seo-to-work">#</a> **Q:** How to get SEO to work in react app built using CRA? – MelvinPhaser

**A:** Prerender! https://create-react-app.dev/docs/pre-rendering-into-static-html-files/

---

<a name="how-are-you" href="#how-are-you">#</a> **Q:** How are you swyx? – thetruthseekah

**A:** I'm ok! My fingers are a bit aching from typing so much. Also I'm stressing out about my [Svelte][svelte] Amsterdam talk later haha https://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-SvelteJS/events/266919637/.

---

<a name="hey-swyx-what-editor" href="#hey-swyx-what-editor">#</a> **Q:** Hey Swyx! What editor theme(s) do you like? 😄 – kpollich

**A:** Lol I default to Ahmad Awais [Shades of Purple](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple#:~:text=Ahmad%20Awais%20%E2%9A%A1&text=%F0%9F%A6%84%20A%20professional%20theme%20suite,VSCode%20Themes%20on%20the%20marketplace.) recently.

---

<a name="classnames-vs-clsx" href="#classnames-vs-clsx">#</a> **Q:** Classnames vs clsx which is better? – fgrgec

**A:** I have only used classnames.

---

<a name="what-do-you-think-of-ssr" href="#what-do-you-think-of-ssr">#</a> **Q:** What do you think of ssr on [golang](https://golang.org/)? – Tee-Sean

**A:** I don't think anything of it haha. I had to write some [golang](https://golang.org/) once, and it was a fine experience, but I didn't feel more productive than in JS. Interested in learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) someday.

---

<a name="can-react-js-be-the-most" href="#can-react-js-be-the-most">#</a> **Q:** Can React JS be the most dominant ever JavaScript library? – Vradhi

**A:** Isn't it?

---

<a name="is-it-better-to-keep-using" href="#is-it-better-to-keep-using">#</a> **Q:** Is it better to keep using GraphQL or Redux for all projects? OR use both of them? OR other better API like hooks maybe? – akram-001

**A:** Use what you enjoy. I think GraphQL needs a lot more tooling to set up, and you only get the most benefits if you can flow the types down from server to frontend. Redux has less setup as it is mostly just frontend.

---

<a name="how-can-someone-learn-and" href="#how-can-someone-learn-and">#</a> **Q:** How can someone learn and contribute to React internal codebase? – einstein92

**A:** I HAVE THE PERFECT TALK FOR YOU LOL https://www.swyx.io/speaking/contributing-to-react/.
